Tasks:
1) Multi label classification (binary vector): Say on school etc
2) Clustering based on ego networks



It should be better than not using them or trivially concatenating them in general tasks such as 
multi-label classification & clustering. 

Tasks:

1) Multi label classification - Mask one attribute at a time and then ...
	Classifier to predict.

2) Clustering on Ego-networks - Facebook.

3) Relationship type classification given a pair of nodes.

3) The basic idea is to learn a projection matrix specific to each relation type. 
What are some useful insights from these matrices? 
	a) Given a pair of nodes, we can predict their most likely relationship type. Can possibly compare against individual versions of existing techniques. 

Basic idea :
